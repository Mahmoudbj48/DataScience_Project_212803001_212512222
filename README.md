- Project Overview
Bankruptcy Prediction Using Financial Data: This is a comprehensive data science project that involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various machine learning models to predict company bankruptcy.

- Important Note
The final chunk of code, which implements GridSearch with the Regular Bagging methods, may take a considerable amount of time to run. To obtain results more quickly, you can reduce the n_iterations parameter to a value less than 5.

Thank you for reviewing our project.
